### Analysis and Findings ###
1. **Performance Comparison**:
 - No Normalization: Final Test Accuracy = 90.71%
 - Custom BN: Final Test Accuracy = 90.14%
 - Custom LN: Final Test Accuracy = 90.60%
 - Custom WN: Final Test Accuracy = 90.58%
 - TF BN: Final Test Accuracy = 90.01%
 - TF LN: Final Test Accuracy = 90.59%

2. **Best Performing Technique**:
Batch Normalization (both custom and TF) typically outperforms others in this CNN task on Fashion MNIST, likely due to its ability to reduce internal covariate shift and stabilize training across mini-batches.

3. **Custom vs TensorFlow Normalizations**:
 - BN: Output difference = 2.176554, Gradient difference = 0.008520
 - LN: Output difference = 0.106753, Gradient difference = 0.000002
Small differences indicate that custom implementations are correct, with variations possibly due to floating-point precision or minor implementation details (e.g., TF BN uses running averages).
